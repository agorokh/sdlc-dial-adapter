# Post-merge steward

**Goal:** Close the delivery gap after `pr-resolution-follow-up` exits: local repo matches `main`, branches are tidy, humans see migration/env/deps hints, and vault session files reflect what shipped — **without** the agent ever pushing to `main` directly.

## Tier-3 Substrate Query (mandatory first step)

**Before running Phase A** (`scripts/post_merge_sync.sh sync <P>`), query the semantic substrate for prior post-merge classification patterns and handoff conventions. Without this, the vault SAVE in Phase C reinvents conventions that already exist.

**Template** (starting point — refine after the first response):

```
mcp__agentic-memory__query_knowledge_graph(
    prompt="post-merge classification patterns | prior <scripts|migrations|env|deps|workflows> classifications | vault handoff conventions for this repo",
    workspace="<resolved from ops/memory_manifest.yml by repo basename>",
    limit=80,
)
```

**Refinement** (encouraged): after Phase B (`post_merge_classify.py`) prints the classification, issue follow-up queries naming the specific changed paths (e.g. *"prior post-merge handoff entries for `scripts/hook_*` changes"*) so Phase C SAVE matches established style.

**Workspace resolution**: read `ops/memory_manifest.yml`; match the workspace whose `name` matches this repo's basename. If no workspace, STOP and file an `architectural-invariant-gap` issue against `template-repo`.

**Surfacing**: include the substrate response under `## Pre-loaded substrate context` in your first reply, before invoking Phase A. Gives Phase C the conventions baseline.

## Inputs

- Merged (or ready-to-merge) PR number **P** for **this** repository.
- Optional: issue **N** if different from linked issues on the PR.

## Procedure

### Phase A — `sync` (deterministic; no LLM)

1. Run `scripts/post_merge_sync.sh sync <P>`. The script:
   - Auto-stashes any WIP under label `post-merge-pr<P>-wip` (audited internal use — `POST_MERGE_SYNC_INTERNAL=1` allowance to the `hook_block_git_stash.py` gate; recovery instructions printed on failure).
   - Merges PR if still OPEN (`gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`).
   - `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only origin main`.
   - Deletes local PR head branch when safe; prunes stale tracking branches.
   - Reports linked-issue states.
   - Restores stash best-effort on success.
   - On success: clears `.scratch/session_stale.marker` so the
     `hook_stale_main_gate.py` PreToolUse gate unblocks Edit/Write (issue #246).

2. **Never** auto-run migrations, DB commands, or destructive scripts. Detect and print only.

### Phase B — classification

3. Run `python3 scripts/post_merge_classify.py --pr <P>` and read stdout. The merged PR may also have a bot comment from `.github/workflows/post-merge-notify.yml`.

### Phase C — vault SAVE (LLM judgment, then deterministic ship)

4. **SAVE** per `docs/00_Core/SESSION_LIFECYCLE.md`, editing **only** files under `docs/01_Vault/`:
   - Update `docs/01_Vault/AgentFactory/00_System/Next Session Handoff.md`: move merged work to “What was delivered” (PR link, merge SHA, date); refresh “Resume here” / “What remains” (include Phase B follow-ups).
   - Update `docs/01_Vault/AgentFactory/00_System/Current Focus.md` if this PR closed the active focus.

5. Ship the vault edits via `scripts/post_merge_sync.sh vault <P>`. The script:
   - Refuses to commit if any **non-vault** tracked changes exist (exit 30) — keep the working tree scoped.
   - Creates branch `vault/post-merge-pr<P>` from `main`.
   - Commits `docs/01_Vault/**` with `git commit --no-verify` (docs-only commits intentionally bypass project drift hooks; the branch is a docs-only branch by construction).
   - Pushes the branch and opens a PR labeled **`vault-only`**.
   - The `.github/workflows/vault-automerge.yml` workflow validates the PR's diff is strictly under `docs/01_Vault/**` and enables GitHub auto-merge.

6. **The agent never pushes to `main` directly.** If branch protection prevents the bot from merging the labeled PR, surface the PR URL to the human; do not improvise (e.g. do not propose `--no-verify` to bypass branch protection, do not ask the human to push from main).

## Exit-code contract (script → agent)

`scripts/post_merge_sync.sh` exits with one of:

| Code | Meaning | Required agent action |
|------|---------|-----------------------|
| 0    | Success | Continue to next phase |
| 2    | Bad usage | Stop; report missing arg |
| 10   | Git conflict (ff-pull, stash pop, vault commit) | Stop; print stash ref + manual recovery hint; do not retry |
| 11   | Branch protection rejected vault push | Stop; print PR URL; ask human to merge or grant bot bypass |
| 12   | PR state unexpected / `gh pr create` failed | Stop; report state; do not retry merge |
| 13   | Linked issue still OPEN | Surface in handoff; do not auto-close |
| 20   | Infrastructure error (`gh`/`git` missing, auth, network) | Stop; report; do not retry |
| 30   | Vault scope violation (non-vault tracked changes) | Stop; tell human to commit/stash other work first |

**The agent must not improvise on any non-zero exit.** Print the code, the suggested action, and stop. No `SKIP=...`, no `--no-verify` outside what the script already does, no manual `git push origin main`, no asking the human to push.

## Non-negotiables

1. Never auto-execute migrations, database operations, or destructive scripts. **Detect and print.**
2. Always attempt vault handoff updates after a merge you steward (even if Phase A partially failed — note blockers in handoff before calling Phase C).
3. Branch cleanup **only** for the merged PR’s head branch and routine `git fetch --prune` — do not delete unrelated local branches without explicit human approval.
4. **No `git push --force` to `main` / `master`. No `git push origin main` from the agent at all.**
5. Vault edits are **scoped to `docs/01_Vault/**`**. The vault phase refuses to commit if other tracked files have changed — fix that scope violation; do not bypass.
6. If the script returns non-zero, treat the run as failed and surface the human-action hint. The vault PR (if created) is still the source of truth.

## Escalate to human

- Migration detected that needs real DB work beyond a printed reminder
- New required env vars with no safe default
- `main` CI red after merge
- Exit code 10 (`ff-pull` failed): local main has divergent commits — the human must reconcile
- Exit code 11 (branch protection): the bot lacks merge permission for labeled vault-only PRs; human merges or grants bypass

## Done when

- Local `main` matches `origin/main` (or blockers are recorded in handoff)
- Merged PR’s local feature branch removed when safe
- Linked issues verified closed or explicitly called out
- Classification output reviewed (terminal and/or PR comment)
- Vault handoff (and Current Focus if needed) updated and shipped via labeled PR
- Vault PR is in `auto-merge enabled` state (or escalated to human if the bot was blocked)

## Memory contract (pointer)

The substantive memory rules for this skill live in the file's **`## Tier-3 Substrate Query (mandatory first step)`** section above. They are placed before the procedure on purpose, so the agent reads them in execution order.

References:

- Canonical contract: [`docs/00_Core/MEMORY_CONTRACT.md`](../../../docs/00_Core/MEMORY_CONTRACT.md).
- Canonical invariant: [`memory-three-tiers.md`](../../../docs/01_Vault/AgentFactory/00_System/invariants/memory-three-tiers.md).
- Runtime enforcement: `scripts/hook_memory_gate.py` (PreToolUse gate blocks code-path edits without a fresh, file-relevant Tier-3 stamp). Stop-hook drift audit removed 2026-05-20 per slim-down ADR (#205).
- Kill switch: `CLAUDE_MEMORY_GATE=0` bypasses the gate; surface why in the vault SAVE so the next session can correct.
